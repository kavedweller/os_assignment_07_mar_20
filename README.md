## SQL Commands Assignment

Complete the following tasks and submit the PHP file and HTML file as part of your assignment.

 

#### Description:  
In this assignment, you will be working with a fictional database of a company named "XYZ Corp." The database contains two tables, employees and departments. Your task is to write SQL commands to retrieve and manipulate data from these tables.  



#### Instructions:  

Use the employees table to answer the following questions:  

<ol type="a">
	<li>Write a query to select all columns and rows from the employees table.</li>
	<li>Write a query to select only the name and salary columns of all employees with a salary greater than 50000.</li>
	<li>Write a query to calculate the average salary of all employees.</li>
	<li>Write a query to count the number of employees who work in the "Marketing" department.</li>
	<li>Write a query to update the salary column of the employee with an id of 1001 to 60000.</li>
	<li>Write a query to delete all employees whose salary is less than 30000.</li>
</ol>

Use the departments table to answer the following questions:  

<ol type="a">
	<li>Write a query to select all columns and rows from the departments table.</li>
	<li>Write a query to select only the name and manager columns of the "Finance" department.</li>
	<li>Write a query to calculate the total number of employees in each department.</li>
	<li>Write a query to insert a new department called "Research" with a manager named "John Doe".</li>
</ol>


#### Deliverables:

- A text file containing all SQL commands written to answer the above questions.  
- A brief explanation of each SQL command and its purpose.  

**Note:** You can assume that both tables have the following columns:

> employees: ```id, name, age, salary, department_id```  
> departments: ```id, name, manager```
